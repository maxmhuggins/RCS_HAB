The over arching goal of this research project is to develop a reaction control system for high altitude balloons. The work completed includes an analysis on viability of the system, an experimental design, data collection, and analysis on it. The experimental design had errors associated with it and because of this the analysis did not provide system characterization. Next steps include correcting the experimental errors, finishing the analysis, integrating the CGT into a HABP, and flying the system.

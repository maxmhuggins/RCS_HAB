Several methods exist which allow scientists to collect various types of data from Earth's atmosphere. High altitude balloons are one of these methods, which provide scientists a cost effective, simple system for data collection. At the cost of simplicity, however they lack control. Sporadic winds in the atmosphere affect data collection for sensors on board these balloon's payloads. A reaction control system would allow stabilization through regions of the atmosphere to allow better data collection. Here, the development of a reaction control system utilizing cold gas thrusters has been outlined. From the decision of fuel to the methods of characterization. An analysis has been done to characterize the behaviour of the thrusters, but due to an incomplete data set the characterization was unable to be completed. A high-level outline on future work has been laid out along with the experimental and analytical scripts.

\end{center}
Several methods exist which allow scientists to collect various types of data from Earth's atmosphere. High altitude balloons are one of these methods, which provide scientists a cost effective, simple system for data collection. At the cost of simplicity, however they lack control. Sporadic winds in the atmosphere affect data collection for sensors on board these balloon's payloads. A reaction control system would allow stabilization through regions of the atmosphere to allow better data collection. Here, the development of a reaction control system has been outlined and analysis has been done to characterize the cold gas thrusters on board the payloads.

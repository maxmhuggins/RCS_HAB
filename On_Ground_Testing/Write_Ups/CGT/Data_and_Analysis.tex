The data taken was for the variables in equation \ref{eq:NozzleForce}. There were a total of 10 nozzle expansion ratios used with 2 trials each. The expansion ratio kept $A_t$ constant and varied $A_e$. There were 4 over expanded, 4 underexpanded, 1 optimum, and 1 with no expansion. They are labelled in the section \ref{nomenclature}.

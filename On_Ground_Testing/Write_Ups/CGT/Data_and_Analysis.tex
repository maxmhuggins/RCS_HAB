The data taken was for the variables in equation \ref{eq:NozzleForce}. There were a total of 10 nozzle expansion ratios used with 2 trials each. The expansion ratio kept $A_t$ constant and varied $A_e$. There were 4 over expanded, 4 underexpanded, 1 optimum, and 1 with no expansion. The naming scheme goes ERT, where E stands for either U (Underexpanded), N (None), or O. O stands for either optimum or overexpanded. R is the ratio number (1-4) except in the case that there is no third character. In this case the O stands for optimum, which there is only one of. T stands for trial number which can be either 1 or 2. So for example, U22 is underexpanded, ratio number 2, trial number 2. O1 is optimum ratio, trial number 1. These are explicitly defined in the nomenclature.%

The data set used for this paper was taken with the purpose of characterizing the cold gas thruster system. This would be done with the use of existing nozzle theory that describes the specific impulse and force equations for a converging-diverging nozzle. The variables \textit{meant} to be measured are $P_c,\ T_e,\ T_c,\ F,$ and $w$ and with them this purpose could be achieved. However, the experimental setup does not represent them correctly. Namely, the $T_e$ sensor is not placed correctly and $w$ is not measured through time. The solutions here are straightforward.\\
The analysis has been done in an object oriented paradigm that allows for ease of analysis for future datasets. In the time that cannot be spent in the lab some changes can be made to the scripting. The code lacks efficiency and readibility. Because of this changes should be made to follow a more standard coding scheme or style.\\
Again, all of this scripting and data is available at this \href{https://github.com/maxmhuggins/RCS_HAB}{GitHub repository}.

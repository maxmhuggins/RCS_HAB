\begin{abstract}
A cold gas thruster (CGT) system was designed with pre-existing nozzle theory in mind. This paper deals with characterizing the system and provides an analysis of the force production for it. It was found that the CGT performed similarly to the predicted theory, but the data collected was not sufficient to characterize the system as was previously expected. Changes must be made to the experimental setup to complete the characterization.

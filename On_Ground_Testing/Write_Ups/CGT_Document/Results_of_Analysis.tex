Unfortunately, the result of this analysis is not significant in terms of directly characterizing the CGT system. The goal was to compare theoretical force and specific impulse data with experimental force and specific impulse data. Obviously, this was not completed here. Plots have been made, different techniques have been used, and values have been found but none of them have much real significance without their theoretical counterparts. The primary value of the analysis performed above is the scripting. All of the scripting was done in python and is object oriented. This means that once the corrections have been made to the experimental apparatus, there is little to no work to be done in terms of analysis.

As of April 5, 2020:
Due to the global pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus, COVID-19 work in 
the lab has effectively stopped. Because of this I wanted to include some 
changes that need to be made to the setup and the software before I forgot.

I won't go into much detail here, mainly just list the psuedo fix.

- Record change in mass of gas
- Either heat the gas or choose a gas with less expansive cooling
- Change the formatting for the text files to be easily read into python
	- Primarily the calibration files with the mass info.
- Update the nomenclature for identifying the nozzle geometries and trials
	- This should allow writing and analysis to be done simply
	- Every individual trial should have a unique identifier
	- O11, O12, O21, O22, etc is good, but the optimum and none should be 
		updated.
- Design PCB for data acquisition system
- Develop library to interface with the 24-bit ADC because the 10-bit one is no
	good for measuring the changes in temperature of the thermocouples.

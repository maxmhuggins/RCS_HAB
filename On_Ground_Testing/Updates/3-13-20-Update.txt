As of Feb. 13, 2020:
An on-ground rig has been built. It has problems, though. The biggest is the 
load cell's mount. It is currently attached to a ring stand via a 3D printed 
part. The current setup causes the load cell innapropriate stresses. I believe 
this is the cause for the erroneous signals I am recieving from the load cell. 
The next problem with the on-ground rig is that the pressure transducer is 
noisy. Whether or not this is an issue of poor wiring I am unsure. Lastly, 
the setup is lackluster in its reliability. Simple movements of the setup will 
cause the sensors to be thrown off calibration. Primarily the load cell, but I 
am sure that the pressure transducer's noisy signals are not satisfactory to 
obtain the results I am interested in. 

Additionally, the electronics are not up to satisfaction. All transducers 
(force, pressure, and temp) are sending analog signals to a 10bit ADC. This 
is a medium resolution device. Pressure changes of something like 1psi are 
nearly undetectable because of the limited resolution. Temperature changes are 
even worse. Changes of 2 degrees Celsius are also undetectable. Along with 
this all of the wiring is done on a breadboard and the long cords leading from 
each sensor to the breadboard are simply twisted inductively paired wires. 
This was done such as to expedite the scripting process and allow development 
to begin and was never meant to be a final solution. Nonetheless, this is also 
unsatisfactory. 

Lastly, the software is not completed. My goal for this is an object oriented 
(OO) software with ease of use and readibility. There is no doubt I could 
complete the software with my current understanding of python and exclude the 
OO aspect and move on. However, as I would like this to be as much of a 
learning experience as it can be along with the completed project being 
rigorous I have chosen to develop the software with OO programming (OOP) in 
mind. There are also limitations to non-OOP that I would like to avoid in this 
project.

In conclusion,

--> What is wrong?
	* Possible solution(s)

(Not in any particular order)

On-Ground Testing Rig:

--> Load cell mount causes poor data readings
	* Design new mount that uses some sort of gimbaling

--> Noisy pressure transducer (!) *SOLVED
	* Write script to determine statistical characteristics of the data
		recieved from the transducer.
	* Do a trial run to determine values for Nyquist's Theorem to 
		determine minimum sample rate needed for the experiment.
	* Determine whether or not the long wire lead is a reason for the poor 
		data by using the other transducer.

--> Poor reliability/repeatability
	* This is largely an issue for the load cell. Any movements of the rig 
		cause the load cell unusual strains. This is a complex issue 
		and I do not currently have a good solution.

Electronics for On-Ground Testing Rig:

--> 10-bit ADC resolution is too low
	* Upgrade to 24-bit ADC that uses I2C communication protocol
		** This means developing a library for the device.

--> Poor wiring
	* Switch to a more reliable standard such as universal serial bus or 
		some sort of shielded standard like ethernet. 

--> Breadboard is a poor choice for sensitive data acquisition
	* Switch to a soldered breadboard
		** Possibly design one online and use squirk or an online
			seller.

Software:
*SOLVED (mostly)
Not really any problems here other than being behind schedule, just a matter 
of completing it in a timely manner. May ask for some help with understanding 
concepts of OOP from someone who has a much better understanding of them.

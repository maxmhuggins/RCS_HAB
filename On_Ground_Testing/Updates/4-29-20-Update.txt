As of March 29, 2020:
I have taken data for 10 different nozzle geometries. I've taken two trials 
for each one, using a total of 21 CO2 canisters. The extra one because I 
ruined a trial.

Admittidely, I did not read enough into the theory and have taken bad data. 
These nozzle equations suggest several things. Of course, the force (F) 
produced per unit mass of propellant is proportional to several things. I will 
list them below:

Variables:
Chamber Pressure
External Pressure
Ambient Pressure
Chamber Temperature
Exit Temperature
Area of the Nozzle Throat
Exit Area of the Nozzle

Constants*
Ratio of heat capacities

*I say constant, but this is variable with temperature. Which means it is 
variable in my system because the temperature is transient.

I have of course run into more problems.

Theory:
The theory, and intuition suggests that the temperature of the chamber should 
be higher than the temperature of the gas exiting the nozzle. This makes sense 
becauses as most gasses expand, they decrease in temperature.* If this is not 
the case, there will be a negative under the square root. Causing imaginary 
parts to the predicted force. Also, the equation for force is highly dependent 
on the temperature of the gas exiting the nozzle. However, the temperatures I 
have measured are not indicative of the chamber temperature and the exit 
temperature. My probes have been placed in the CO2 adaptor (the chamber 
temperature) and on the copper tube that the nozzle is attached to. This did 
not provide good data. I need to somehow put a probe directly inside of the 3D 
printed nozzle for the chamber temperature and either directly in the stream of 
exhaust gas or inside the exit area of the nozzle. Lastly, these equations are 
per unit of mass. My unit is kg and for each time unit, the mass of the 
propellant used is unknown. Therefore, I do not think I can apply the equations 
how I have been. Unless I were to take mass data of the CO2 canister throughout 
each trial I will have to go about this differently.

*As I'm writing this I'm unsure of whether or not the theory works out for 
gasses with negative Joule-Thompson coefficients (meaning they heat when they 
expand.) But I have confidence that the ratio of specific heats probably 
handles this and does not allow for imaginary forces with these types of gasses.

Setup:
The main problem with the setup is actually not the force probe, as I was 
previously worried about. It is the fact that the CO2 so quickly discharges 
that a portion of it turns solid. This means a few things:

- Condensation inside the piping that affects the force output
- Some of the mass is lost between the end of the experiment and measuring the 
	final mass. 
- I'm unsure if this messes with the calibration on the pressure sensor due to 
	the differences in temperature.

In conclusion,

--> What is wrong? (!: means cannot be ignored to continue)
        * Possible solution(s)

(Not in any particular order)

Theory:

--> Wrong temperature data (!)
        * Place temperature sensors more appropriately
	* Change data analysis to more general

--> Temperature resolution is poor
	* Use 24-bit ADC
	* Change data analysis to more general

--> Mass is unknown (!)
	* Use another load cell to support CO2 and measure changes in mass with 
		this
	* Change data analysis to more general

Rig:

--> CO2 turns to dry ice
	* Use a heater and feedback system to stop this from happening
		* This would also require a slower release of gasses
			meaning a smaller throat size.
